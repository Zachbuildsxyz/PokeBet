# Contributing

This repo is public for transparency and learning.

## Ground rules
- Keep changes small and readable
- No hype language
- If risk rules change, update `docs/risk-policy.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`

## What’s welcome
- Documentation improvements
- Logging + tooling
- Tests and safety checks

The mission stays fixed: defined risk, quiet execution, built to provide.
